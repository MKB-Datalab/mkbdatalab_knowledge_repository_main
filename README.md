[Data Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) is still an unclear concept for most entrepreneurs. Its application in daily practice is often still a long way off, 
and the [JADS MKB Datalab](https://jadsmkbdatalab.nl/over-ons/) is changing that. 

To reduce the gap between the latest data science techniques and the application of these techniques in start-ups, SMEs (Small and Medium sized Enterprises) and larger organizations, 
[JADS](https://www.jads.nl/) Data Science Master students execute briefly defined projects and develop tools within the JADS MKB Datalab.

The MKB Datalab Knowledge Repository reinforces this mission, sharing projects/tutorials that illustrate how data science techniques are applied and how they can benefit businesses.

Within this repository you will find examples of tools and techniques often used at the MKB Datalab while helping many SMEs in The Netherlands becoming more data driven.

:computer: **CODE** : [Projects](https://github.com/dpbac/projects_knowledge_repository_test) presented here are made in form of a tutorial so you can apply the same techniques
easily to similar cases. The codes presented in this repository are property of MKB Datalab who authorize their use (See [LICENSE](https://github.com/dpbac/test_mkb_knowledge_repo/blob/master/LICENSE)).

:information_source: **DATASETS** : In order to show the use of the code and allow reproducibility without compromising aspects such as copyright and privacy we have searched 
for public datasets that would fit the use case considered.

Like this, we hope to provide a valuable source for students, enterprises, and anyone interested in data science and entrepreneurship.
